## Usage

You can use [SEN Tracker](https://github.com/sen-laboratories/sen-tracker) to navigate Related files using the context menu "Open Related...".

Together with the ontologies in [ONI (Ontology Native Interface)](https://github.com/sen-laboratories/sen-oni), you can start to explore the magic of a truly semantic desktop, managing all your real-world and virtual objects, abstract entities and ideas as files.

Other use cases and plugins are currently under development.
